    <p>For this assignment, we were asked to read Elinor Fuchs’, <u>Visit to a Small
    Planet</u>, and then to create a scene in the Unreal Engine using only starter assets. The article
    asks the reader to consider a series of questions prior to creating the world for their story. The
    author encourages the creator to really think about what they would see and feel if they were in
    the world being created. For example, some questions that are posed to the reader include: how
    does time feel on this planet and what is the mood of the planet? Out of all the questions asked,
    there were a few that stood out for me and became the inspiration for the world I was creating.</p>
  	<p>The author’s query that spurred the creation of my world related to how I felt time would
    work on my fictitious planet. To assist with the reader’s thought process, Fuchs provided
    suggestions as to how her question may be answered. One of the suggestions I pondered was, is
    time eternal? This spawned an idea of a world where a superior being can oversee and view other
    planets in the universe by manipulating time and space. The planets could be viewed from atop a
    mountain on the balcony of an ancient building filled with pillars that seemed to stretch forever.
    That mountain would also overlook a lush forest, making the building more of a hideaway. It
    wasn’t until I read further into the article, however, that my initial concept began to evolve.</p>
    <p>The idea of having a world without living beings is not very interesting and would not provide
    the context for the characteristics of the world. The next series of questions addressed this, and
    focused on the characters of the world. Who are the people on this planet? Who would populate
    my world? Based on the author’s questions and the concept I had in mind, I thought the best
    character for this world would be an old wizard-type who would use some form of technology to
    manipulate time from the balcony of the building. As I thought more about the world and its
    character, I recalled a quote in the document which states that “nothing in the play is without
    significance”. This made a lot of sense to me. The beauty on the planet that I originally thought
    about, such as the forest and the ancient building, actually took away from the real mission of my
    character; that is, the guardian of time and space. The beautiful backdrop that I originally
    included, turns out to be a distraction for the character, and therefore, doesn’t fit with the overall
    story. I decided to rethink the world, making it more desolate and remote. In this way, my
    character is more focused on his responsibilities, and the mood is more of solitude and intent. I
    repurposed the pillars of the building to act as a tower with a single lit flame in the center; no
    more distractions for the character as it protects time and space. Because of the questions posed
    by Elinor Fuchs, I believe my world and its character are blended and cohesive. What we are left
    with is a calm and desolate planet where the old wizard, a guardian of time, overlooks and
    protects the universe.</p>

    <h1>Homework 5</h1>
    <p>The team was made up of Daniel Lee, Jason Wang and myself for this assignment.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>The World</h1>
    <img src="Homework1_Screenshot1.png" width="800vmin"></img>
    <p>This world is home to a wizard who can control time and space. The planet was chosen for its remote and barren landscape; making it perfect due to the lack of noise and distractions.  A singular pillar was placed on this world by the wizard to act as a guard tower as he maintained order to the universe. From there, all the other planets in the universe can be seen and navigated to through the powers of the wizard. </p>

    <h1>The Movement</h1>

    <p>For my wizard, I wanted to have a strong and direct form of movement in Labanotation. When directing, I described my character as having a confident and slightly aggressive walk with exaggerated arm movements. He was going to stand with his hands on his hips and his head held high since he’s a powerful being and nothing can hurt him. During the early takes, the movement, specifically the walk, looked too happy for the character I had in mind. So instead our actor Jason took a more aggressive approach to the walk and it turned out to be much better than how I imagined it. The final product was my wizard character stomping towards the edge of the tower and making an aggressive gesture before the video ends.</p>
