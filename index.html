    <p>For this assignment, we were asked to read Elinor Fuchs <u>Visit to a Small Planet</u>, and then create a scene in the Unreal Engine using only starter assets. The article asks the creator to really think about what they see and feel if they were on the world being built by them. Questions are posed to the reader such as: how does time feel on this planet and what is the mood of the planet? Out of all the questions asked, there were a few that stood out and became the inspiration for the world I was creating.</p>
  	<p>The question that started the creation of this world was how does time feel on this planet? After reading this question the article proceeded to give suggestions as to how I would answer it. One of the suggestions was is time eternal? This spawned the idea of a world where a superior being can oversee other planets and be able to manipulate time and space view other planets in the universe. The planets could be viewed from atop of mountain on the balcony of an ancient building filled with pillars that seemed to stretch forever. That mountain would also overlook a lush forest, making the building more of a hideaway. It wasn’t until I got further into the document that my idea started to change.</p>
    <p>There were a series of questions that focused on the characters of this world such as who are the people on this planet? Who would populate my world? Based on the question and the concept I had in mind, I thought the best character for this world would be an old wizard who would use some form of technology to manipulate time from the balcony of the building. As I am thinking more about the world and its character, I recalled a quote in the document which stated, “nothing in the play is without significance”. The beauty on the planet such as the forest and building were just there to be beautiful and didn’t aid in my character’s responsibilities. I decided to rethink the world, making it more desolate and remote. The pillars I created for the building were repurposed as a tower with a single lit flame in the center; no more distractions for the character as it protects time and space. Because of the questions posed by Elinor Fuchs, the world and, its character all blended and made a lot more sense. What we are left with is a calm and desolate planet where the old wizard, a guardian of time, overlooks the universe.</p>
